# Enrollment Metric Tracker

Using excel software built a personal project for my team manager at (WGU Western Governors University) that keeps track of metrics and then calculates daily and weekly goals (using personalized math equations, conditional formatting, and formulas) based on company expectations. Later upper management took note, praised my work, and decided to incorporate it on broader scale across the organization.
